// Do this : function add(a: number, b: number): number { return null }

TypeScript Fundamentals v3
Learn everything you need to know in order to confidently and successfully use TypeScript to build a modern JavaScript app.
01Intro
June 08, 2021
We'll discuss the goals and agenda of this course, and how to get up and running with the workshop project in 2 minutes or less.

02Hello TypeScript
June 08, 2021
In this chapter, we'll get hands on with our first TypeScript program and the compiler CLI command, and examine a simple program's compiled output

03Variables and Values
June 08, 2021
We will begin our study of the TypeScript language with simple variables and functions.

04Objects, Arrays and Tuples
June 08, 2021
Now that we know how to type simple variables and functions, let's make things a bit more interesting with collections: in JavaScript this includes Objects and Arrays.

05Structural vs. Nominal Types
June 08, 2021
In this unit, we will explore how TypeScript is fundamentally different from nominal type systems, such as the ones found in Java and C++.

06Union and Intersection Types
June 08, 2021
We will discuss and explore TypeScript's union and intersection types, which are effectively "AND" and "OR" boolean logic operators for types.

07Interfaces and Type Aliases
June 08, 2021
TypeScript provides two mechanisms for centrally defining types and giving them useful and meaningful names: interfaces and type aliases. We will study both concepts in depth, and explain when it makes sense to use each.

08JSON types
June 08, 2021
We will take on our first challenge together: defining types that describe any valid JSON value

09Functions
June 08, 2021
So far, we have dealt with function argument and return types. There are a few more in-depth features we need to cover, including multiple function heads and callable types.

10Classes
June 08, 2021
TypeScript classes add some powerful and important features on top of traditional JavaScript classes. In this unit, we will take a close look class fields, access modifier keywords and more!

11Top and bottom types
June 08, 2021
Top types can be anything, bottom types can't be anything. We will also look at three "extreme types" in TypeScript: any, unknown and never.

12Type guards and narrowing
June 08, 2021
We have explored built-in type guards like typeof and instanceof, but there's a lot more power in type guards, including the ability to define your own!

13Nullish values
June 08, 2021
There are situations where we have to plan for, and deal with the possibility that values are null or undefined. In this chapter, we will dive deep into null, undefined, definite assignment, and the non-null assertion operator.

14Generics
June 08, 2021
Generics allow us to parameterize types, which unlocks great opportunity to reuse types broadly across a TypeScript project.

15Dictionary map, filter and reduce
June 08, 2021
Many of us use array the higher-order functions map, filter and reduce quite often. Let's build out similar utilities that operate on dictionaries!

16Generics Scopes and Constraints
June 10, 2021
In this chapter, we'll learn about scopes and constraints, as they pertain to type params, and what the language would look like if we didn't have these important tools
